some scripts for rasberry pi 

* LED/blinkLED.py -->let one LED blink by using a loop and set the GPIO to LOW or HIGH
* LED/blinkPWM.py -->controll a LED with PWM - switch LED on for 0.25 sec and off for 0.75 sec setuped for 1Hz. So it will be done every second
* LED/blink_changeFrequence --> uses the PWM frequence to change the blinky velocity - first make in a loop faster and back again to 1Hz
